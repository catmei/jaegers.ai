And do you think that LeBron would agree to any of that? No. Can you imagine how awkward that dinner would have been with that big binder? LeBron would have thrown that binder in the trash.

Because I would get if there was some obvious move to make that they just refused to make. Like, remember when they could have gotten Kyrie Irving a few years ago? He had a horrible reputation in Brooklyn so they could have got him for cheap, but LA refused to do that and he goes to Dallas instead for cheap and they make the finals. Like that was a big mistake, an obvious move out there that they refused to do. But right now, what is it, LeBron? Andrew Wiggins? Really?",

Now, I'm not saying it's likely, but LA has a plan. Now, does Giannis actually want to be a Laker? Because that seems kind of relevant. Well, did you hear what Giannis just said about that with I show speed? A lot of people try to convince me, try to convince me to go and play there and stuff. Oh, no. Not great. Now Giannis might have been trolling a bit, because he also was like, am I gonna play in Milwaukee? He said, probably, I don't know, we'll see. Probably. Probably. We'll see. Yeah, so he's doing a little trolling. But there is one other name, and it's Nicola Jokic. Now normally I would say that Joker is a one team guy his whole career, like Dirk Nowitzki or Tim Duncan. But did you see what the Nuggets owner just said the other day? Like completely unprompted. No one even asked him a question. Dude said this.",

Another option would be a buyout, but I don't see the Lakers having 50 million in dead money on their books for LeBron. And if LeBron actually wanted to buy out, why did he pick up that option in the first place? Now, Luca can sign a new Lakers contract starting August 2nd, and if he likes their plan to build around him instead of LeBron, then we officially have a new era in LA. But I already did a deep dive on where LeBron could go next.",
